/* Header info for vector.c. This file describes all of the
   functions you'll need to implement. Your submission will
   need to have functions in vector.c that have these exact
   same signatures: same number of parameters, same parameter
   types, same return types, and same function name.
   
   I'd recommend beginning by copying all of the function
   signatures (prototypes) into vector.c and adding a minimal
   body to each one (i.e., just opening and closing braces, and
   something like return 0 if you need to have a return statement).
   Then work through the functions to implement them.

struct Vector
{
    // A pointer to a traditional C array to hold data
    int *array;

    // The size of the actual C array that you have allocated
    int memorySize;

    // The virtual size of the vector, i.e. how much data is in it
    // from the user's perspective
    int size;
};

/* Typing "struct Vector" all the time is cumbersome, this sets it up so you can
 just type "Vector" instead. */

typedef struct Vector Vector;


/* Function prototypes. */

/* Take an already existing Vector as a parameter. (Do not create a Vector
 inside this function. Set its internal memory size to match the value given in
 the parameter, allocate an appropriately-sized C array to hold the actual data,
 and initialize the size variable to 0. */

/* Insert value at location inside the Vector. If the list has items in
 positions 0 through n-1, you are only permitted to insert new values at
 locations 0 through n. (This is identical to Java's ArrayList behavior.) If
 there is already data at the location you are inserting into, insert slides the
 rest of the data down one position to make room for the new value. Returns 1 if
 success, and 0 if the location is invalid (less than 0, or greater than the
 size). Inserting at the very end of the current data (at position equal to
 size) is fine. All inserts should increase size by 1.
  
 If the internal array is too small to fit a new value, a new array of twice the
 size is created with malloc. The values are copied, the Vector is appropriately
 updated, and the old array is freed.) */

/* Obtains value at location inside the Vector. Returns 1 if success, and 0 if
 the location is invalid (not a location with a number currently stored). 
 The value itself is returned through the parameter value. */

/* Deletes value at location inside the Vector.  Returns 1 if success, and 0 if
 the location is invalid (less than 0, or greater than or equal to the
 size). When an item is deleted, everything else past it in the array should be
 slid up to fill the empty space (again, like Java's ArrayLiist). The internal 
 array itself does not need to be compressed, i.e., you don't need to halve it 
 in size if it becomes half full, or anything like that. */
